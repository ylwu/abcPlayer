To_decide: Do we want the LEFTPAR to be tokenized separted or with the number following it? eg."(3","(4"
           Do we want to change the name LENGTH to number and represent any number (it can either be
           the length of the note or the number that determines the type of Tuplets
           Do we want LENGTH to have field type string or float or int?
